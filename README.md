## Pharmacy technical test
I have been asked to create a Javascript application with two main functionality:
* Create formulary (pharmacy.js/ addMedication):
    ** Medication can be added to formulary only from the medications list (datasamp.js)
    ** Medication can only be added once to the formulary
    ** Return list of added medications

* Create Inventory (pharmacy.js/ createInventory)
    ** Only medication on medications in formulary can be added to the list(the formulary which is created by addMedication)
